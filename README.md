# CAD code

The goal of this repository is to provide a simple way to work with [build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d).
As `build123d` is currently not available on NixOS, it is provided through a Docker container.

To start the container, issue `docker compose up -d` on the command line.
To stop it, issue `docker compose down`.

The container will monitor all Python scripts located in the `models` directory.
Each time a script is modified, it is executed by the Python interpreter.

In order to preview the models generated by the scripts, [f3d](https://github.com/f3d-app/f3d) is used as it is available on NixOS.
`f3d` comes with a `--watch` option, this means that a Python `build123d` script can be edited and have its preview updated as soon as the script exports its model.
